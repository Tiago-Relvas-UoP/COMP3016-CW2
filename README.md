Repo for COMP3016, Coursework 2

## Project Description
"Peaceful coexistence" is a simple immersive 3D Scene built in OpenGL that explores a human and an alien peacefully flying in the middle of the ocean, above the clouds

This 3D Scene features:
- A 3D Water Surface that blends in 2 mixed textures, and a gradient Color
- Procedurally generated clouds using Perlin Noise that continously fluctuate over the runtime of the application
- 3D Animated Models: An UFO, and a plane
- Dynamic Lighting source (Sun) that illuminates all scene objects
- Fluid First-person movement (WASD/Camera)
- A relaxing Ambience music

## Dependencies used.
This project used the following dependencies:
- GLAD: Essential Library for a bunch of OpenGL Functions.
- GLFW: Responsible for allowing Window Creationg, context management and all input handling.
- GLM: Math. Library responsible for all vector/matrix operations and transformations.
- Assimp: Responsible for loading all 3D Models within the scene that use OBJ/FBX format.
- stb_image: Responsible for loading images, used as textures.
- IrrKlang: Responsible for audio playback (Ambience Noise)
- FastNoiseLite: Responsible for providing Perlin Noise, used in the procedurally generated terrain (Clouds)
